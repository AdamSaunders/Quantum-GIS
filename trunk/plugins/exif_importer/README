         QGIS EXIF IMPORTER PLUGIN

##############################################

This is a plugin for Quantum GIS (http://qgis.org). It can
import a set of EXIF JPEG pictures, downloaded from a 
digital camera, and use a recorded GPS track in a GPX file
to calculate the positions were the pictures were taken.
Then it writes those positions as waypoints in a new GPX
file, with the URL attribute set to the filename of the
corresponding picture.

New versions will be available at http://community.qgis.org.
