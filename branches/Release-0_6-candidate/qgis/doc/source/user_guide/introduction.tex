\chapter{Introduction}
Quantum GIS (QGIS) is designed to be a Geographic Information System
(GIS) built for Linux/Unix, Mac OSX, and Windows. QGIS currently offers basic support for
vector (both disk-based and database) and raster formats. 

QGIS is released under the GNU Public License. You should have received a full copy of the license with your copy of QGIS.

\section{Whats New in 0.6}
New features in version 0.6 include:
\begin{compactenum}
\item GEOS support in the OGR provider to refine selection of features via identify. This improves over the previous method of feature selection which used a simple MBR intersection check.
\item PostGIS editing support in provider
\item Vector dialog redesign to improve usability
\item Improvement in project handling (loading and saving)
\item Scale dependent rendering
\item User option to load layers with out drawing them, thus allowing you to set scale dependency, etc without waiting for the initial draw to complete
\item Interrupt drawing of features by hitting ESC
\item Attribute actions - the ability to run an external program based on the contents of an attribute field in a layer
\item Create new vector layer (shapefile) for editing
\item Windows installer
 Mac OSX binary
\item New options in the graticule builder plugin
\item Enhancements to the GPS plugin
\item Man page
\item Save delimited text as shapefile
\item Improved Delimited Text plugin, including preview of text file
\item Improved SPIT handling of PostgreSQL reserved words and shapefiles with multiple geometry types
\item Display SQL query used to create a PostGIS layer
\item PostgreSQL query builder
\item Ability to redefine the query used for PostgreSQL layers from the layer properties dialog
\item North arrow, scalebar, and copyright plugins save their state in the project file
\item Datasets with UTF8, Kanjii and CJK filenames now load properly
