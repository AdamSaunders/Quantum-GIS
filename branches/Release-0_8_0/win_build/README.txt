 Notes for using NSIS installer scripts.

---------------------------------------

The installer script has an optional data
download part. This requires an NSIS 
plugin available here:

http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ZipDLL
or
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ZipDLL_plug-in

Follow the instructions on that page before
attempting to run the installer.

NOTE: the zipdll.nsh at the download was 
broken at time of writing this. Use the 
one provided in this directory instead
(still copy it to your nsis include dir 
though).
